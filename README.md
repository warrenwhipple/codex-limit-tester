# codex-limit-tester

This repository contains a simple Node.js application used to explore how
additional dependencies impact a containerized environment. The project is
initialized with `npm` and includes a single test using Node's built-in testing
framework.

## Running Tests

```
npm test
```

The test runner will execute files in the `test` directory using `node --test`.
